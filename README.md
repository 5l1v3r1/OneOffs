# OneOffs
Small random scripts for various things I find myself needing to repeat/automate

Brief descriptions follow -

urlquote.py
* Percent encode/decode strings used in URLs.

cuckoo_submit.py
* Submit files to Cuckoo servers with different configs and read reports by passing ID.

* Convert Maltego graph files to importable OpenIOC MISP reports.

pe_meta.py
* Print PE meta data such as FileVersion, InternalName, FileDescription, etc.

caretperm.py

psorder.py
* Takes base64 encoded PowerShell and replaces obfuscated ordered string arrays with whatever string they would normally build.
